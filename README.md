## ML Apartment Price Prediction

ML Apartment Price Prediction is a semester-long project developed as part of my Computer Science
master's studies, initiated by me as a self-chosen topic for the "Applications of machine learning" course.

The goal I set was to build a regression model in Azure Machine Learning that predicts apartment prices in Cracow based on historical data from Kaggle. The project covers the entire ML pipeline from data
exploration and preprocessing, through algorithm selection and training, to model deployment.

The process is documented in detail in a 60-page report â€” currently the best way to showcase the full Azure
ML pipeline, which is hard to visualize otherwise. That model is intended to be one of the key components in
my future mini-OTODOM-style app featuring ML-powered price suggestions along with additional models
built using Azure ML and ML.NET.
